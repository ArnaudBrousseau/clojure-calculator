# Functional calculator

This app is a simple calculator written in Clojure. It's also my first try at
functional web programming. (I've done some to solve trivial algorithmic
problems...but web programming brings a whole different class of problems)

## Usage example

/add?args=1,2,-30,5,
/subtract?args=30,5,8
/multiply?args=20,4,-1
(no, it doesn't work yet)
